The dataset contains a number of features of songs from 2017 and a binary variable `target` that represents whether the user liked the song (encoded as 1) or not (encoded as 0). See the documentation of all the features [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features). \n",

There are two different histograms, one for target = 0 and one for target = 1, and they are overlaid on top of each other. The histogram shows that extremely quiet songs tend to be disliked (more blue bars than orange on the left) and very loud songs also tend to be disliked (more blue than orange on the far right).\n",
